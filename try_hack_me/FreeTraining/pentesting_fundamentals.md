# Pentesting fundamentals

## What is  a penetration testing

A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.

## Penetration Testing Ethics

A penetration test is an authorised audit of a computer system's security and defences, agreed by the owners of the systems.
Before it starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. tools and systems to be tested are agreed on. The discusion forms the scope of the pentest agreement and will determine the course the penetration test takes.

Ethics is the moral debate between right and wrong; where an action may be legal, it may go against an individual's belief system of right and wrong.

Hackers are sorted into three hats:
1. white hat
2. Grey hat
3. Black hat

### Rules of Engagement (ROE)

Is a document created at the initial stages of the penetration testing engagement. consists of threee main sections:

1. Permission => This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.
2. Test scope => This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.
3. Rules => The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.

## Pentration Testing Methodologies

 general theme of the following stages:

 1. Information gathering => OSINT and reseach *NOTE:* this not involve scanning any systems
 2. Enumeration/Scanning => discovering applications and services running on a system
 3. Exploitaiton => involves leveragin vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. public exploits or exploiting application logic
 4. Privilege Escalation => Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).
 5. Post-Exploitation => this stage involves different sub-stages:
 	- What other hosts can be targereted (pivoting)
 	- What additional info can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user
 	- Covering your tracks
 	- Reporting

### OSSTMM

The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.

The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:

Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)
Wired Networks
Wireless communications

Advantages:
- Covers various testing strategies in-depth
- Includes testing strategies for specific targets
- The framework is flexible depending upon the organisation's needs
- The framework is meant to set a standard for systems and applications, meaning that universal methodology can be used in a penetration testing scenario

Disadvantages:
- The framework is difficult to understand, vey detailed and tends to use unique definitions.

### OWASP

The Open Web Application Security Project framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.

The foundation regularly writes reports stating the top ten security vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing approach, and remediation.

Advantages:
- Easy to understand
- Actively maintained
- it cover all stages of an engagement
- Specialises in web applications services

Disadvantages:
- It may not be clear what type of vulnerability a application has
- OWASP does not make suggestions to any specific software development cycles.
- The framework doesn't hold any accreditation such as CHECK

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honourable mention because of its popularity and detail.

The framework provides guidelines on security controls & benchmarks for success for organisations from critical infrastructure (power plants, etc.) all through to commercial.  There is a limited section on a standard guideline for the methodology a penetration tester should take.

### NCSC CAF

The Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.

The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:

Data security
System security
Identity and access control
Resiliency
Monitoring
Response and recovery planning

## Black box, White box, Grey box Penetration Testing

There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service. Your understanding of your target will determine the level of testing that you perform in your penetration testing engagement. In this task, we'll cover these three different scopes of testing.

### Black box testing

This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.

The tester acts as a regular user testing the functionality and interaction of the application or piece of software. This testing can involve interacting with the interface, i.e. buttons, and testing to see whether the intended result is returned. No knowledge of programming or understanding of the programme is necessary for this type of testing.

Black-Box testing significantly increases the amount of time spent during the information gathering and enumeration phase to understand the attack surface of the target.

### Grey box testing

This testing process is the most popular for things such as penetration testing. It is a combination of both black-box and white-box testing processes. The tester will have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or piece of software. Still, it will be interacting with the application as if it were a black-box scenario and then using their knowledge of the application to try and resolve issues as they find them.

With Grey-Box testing, the limited knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extremely well-hardened attack surfaces.

### White box testing

This testing process is a low-level process usually done by a software developer who knows programming and application logic. The tester will be testing the internal components of the application or piece of software and, for example, ensuring that specific functions work correctly and within a reasonable amount of time.

The tester will have full knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour and is much more time consuming than black-box testing. The full knowledge in a White-Box testing scenario provides a testing approach that guarantees the entire attack surface can be validated.
